# LMI-studies
My studies on using Linear Matrix Inequalities to solve control problems
I'm using YALMIP and SEDUMI on matlab, both are free to be downloaded and used in matlab(or python if you're feeling spicy)
Some of the exercises will be taken from Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) Optimization (2022.1) - Master's Program in Electrical Engineering - Federal University of Ceara.
Some of the exersices will be taken from "LMIs in Control Systems: Analysis, Design and Applications" -  Guang-Ren Duan (Author), Hai-Hua Yu (Author)
For reference, i used the aforementioned book and some slides provided by the class professor, the book can be easily found.
